# Using LLMs to generate unit tests

Check the notebooks. This is the workflow

- Notebook 01 - Generate unittest for a single function and measure code quality metrics on the generated code.
- Notebook 02 - Generate unittest for a full repo.
- Notebook 03 - Generate counter-function, that ensures that the generated unittests fail.
